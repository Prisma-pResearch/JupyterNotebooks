    "# Introduction to Medical coding standards\n",
    "\n",
    "In this module, you will learn more details about EHR data from a deeper view. \n",
    "\n",
    "From our last module, we learned that Electronic Health Record (EHR) data is vast and collected from various clinicians. Clinicians in different clinical divisions may use different clinical terms to refer to the same cases, making it difficult to unify the concept or values of identical devices, observations, or measurements across the health system. To address this challenge, we need to find univeral standards to represent these concepts or values in a consistent manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are some widely used coding standards. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. LOINC \n",
    "\n",
    "Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (LOINC) is a universally accepted coding system in the medical industry that enables healthcare providers to share test results and medical information. LOINC codes provide a unique, standardized way to identify medical test results, allowing for accurate comparison of results and better communication between healthcare providers. LOINC codes are used to identify medical tests and observations, results of examinations and procedures, and medical histories and other medical information. They enable laboratory information systems to accurately identify the types of tests being performed and the results being reported, so that the same test performed in different laboratories can be compared. This helps to ensure that healthcare providers are using the same language to communicate about tests and results and ensure that the different components of a patient's medical record are properly linked, allowing for more efficient data management. \n",
    "\n",
    "A unique code (format: nnnnn-n) is assigned to each laboratory test. Current codes are from 3-7 characters long. \n",
    "\n",
    "LOINC also creates clinician-friendly text label (name) to represent each concept. Here are some examples of LOINC codes along with their LOINC names.\n",
    "\n",
    "* 2160-0 Creatinine [Mass/volume] in Serum or Plasma\n",
    "* 26464-8 Leukocytes[#/volume] in Blood\n",
    "* 6690-2 Leukocytes[#/volume] in Blood by Automated count.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at some examples with structured EHR datasets for laboratory tests. "

    "The International Classification of Diseases (ICD), produced by the World Health Organization (WHO), is an internationally standard set of codes used by healthcare systems to refer to health conditions and diseases. ICD codes are used to assign a code to each diagnosis or procedure, allowing for easy and accurate tracking of medical data across different countries and language barriers.\n",

    "\n",
    "Before October 2015, Medicare claims were reported via version ICD-9-CM for all applicable procedure and diagnosis codes. Starting in October 2015, however, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) required Medicare claims to be reported using ICD-10-CM. While the ICD-9-CM system had approximately 13,000 codes and was at risk of running out of numbers, the newer ICD-10-CM system has the capability of having approximately 68,000 numbers. The extra room for additional codes is necessary because ICD-10-CM is a more detailed system than its predecessor. Many ICD-10-CM codes are more specific and granular in their references to anatomy, etiology, comorbidity, and complications, thus allowing for a more specific definition of illness severity. The newest version of the diagnosis code is ICD-11-CM, which went into use on January 1, 2022.\n",
