    "\n",
    "But still, not all health systems will use the same data model. And also, with the increasing usage of mobile phones, IoT devices, health information needs to be collected not only from health systems, but from more diversed scenarios. \n",

    "To enable the communication and exchange of the data between different applications and health systems, a standard for [health information exchange(HLE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_information_exchange) is needed. FHIR is a next-generation protocol for such tasks."

    "Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standards define how the rules and guidelines for how to exchange EHR data. FHIR (pronounced “fire”) is intended to be used throughout many settings and healthcare IT systems and to enable an efficient and secure method to transfer EHRs. Created by [Health Level Seven International (HL7)](https://www.hl7.org/) FHIR provides a standardized set of formats and elements (or “resources”) along with a web-based suite of application programming interface (API) technologies, such as the [HTTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP)-based [RESTful](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) protocol and data representation via [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON), [XML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML), or [RDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework).\n",
    "\n",
    "By incorporating technology and standards that software developers were already using, FHIR offers a low barrier of entry for software developers who are new to the healthcare field.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tons of applications and softwres have been developed based on FHIR standards such as [Apple Health App](https://www.apple.com/healthcare/health-records/), Android's [CommonHealth App](https://www.commonhealth.org/) and etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### FHIR resources\n",
    "\n",
    "FHIR breaks down healthcare information into distinct categories (patients, lab results, claims, etc.), and then a FHIR Resource is used to represent each category. To make up a patient record, the FHIR Resource defines the component and the data elements, constraints, and relationships that form a record. Resources are any content that is exchangeable, such as the following examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "* a document\n",
    "* an image\n",
    "* a temporal service\n",
    "* a collection of other resources\n",
    "* a non-virtual object (such as a person)\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, in each resource, it will include multiple layers of information shown as below:\n",
    "\n",
    "![FHIR resources](./Images/FHIRresources.png)\n",
    "<center> The image is credit to<a href = \"https://build.fhir.org/overview-arch.html\"> hl7 FHIR Overview</a></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "The intent of FHIR is to provide Resources that can fulfill the requirements for most common use cases. In every Resource, there are data elements specific to its own use case as well as links to necessary data found in other Resources. In the Patient Resource, for instance, you will find demographic information, patient contact data, and links that connect to the appropriate provider stored in a separate Resource.\n",
    "\n",
    "In its basic form, a Resource does not need for a majority of its data elements to have a value assigned. After being customized for real-world applicability via the Profiling process, however, the required data elements are established to ensure the functionality of the specific Resource. The Patient Resource, for instance, could be Profiled to mandate that a patient name, street address, and cell phone number are all required in order to facilitate patient matching.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example below, you will see the main parts of a Resource: the Resource itself, the data summary in a human-readable form, an extension with its associated data, and the actual structured data.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### RESTful APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "Application programming interfaces (APIs) are rulesets that specify the way in which applications and devices can connect and exchange data. When an API adheres to the design guidelines of the REST (representational state transfer architectural style), it is referred to as a RESTful API.\n",
    "RESTful APIs are applied to build the communication rules between clients (users) and servers (data warehouse). \n",
    "\n",
    "Each RESTful API will be defined with SCRUD (Search & Read, Create, Update and Delete) interactions, and each action is defined by the HTTP(s) method:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Action | HTTP request method|\n",
    "|-------|--------------------|\n",
    "| Create | POST               |\n",
    "| Search & Read | GET |\n",
    "| Update | PUT|\n",
    "| Delete | DELETE|\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of HTTP components for FHIR requests:\n",

    "### FHIR ecosystem\n",
    "\n",
    "As we learned from previous sections, FHIR is a standard to exchange the health information. It warps the data elements and formats as FHIR **resources** and build the interactions between clients and servers with **RESTful APIs**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Patients, researchers, health care providers, developers and organizations could play with different roles corresponding to their requirements and goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, providers upload or update the clinical data and results to the data warehouse, researchers fetch the data from data warehouse for their interested cohort. Developers are able to build software and applications to visulize the data from data warehouse and patients will be able to check their clinical records through the applications.\n",

    "### FHIR versions\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Draft Standard for Trial Use 1 (DSTU1)\n",
    "FHIR was first published in September 2013. That first draft standard contained 49 resources and was geared toward to use cases specific to mobile devices: creation of a Personal Health Record and document retrieval. After this first release, there was widespread interest in broadening FHIR so that it could be used for a more expansive range of healthcare IT needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Draft Standard for Trial Use 2 (DSTU2)\n",
    "In 2015, the second draft standard for FHIR led to a greater market acceptance. Efforts of EHR developers to adopt FHIR were now supported by the Argonaut Project and its recently developed implementation guides. With the second draft standard, FHIR Resources were structured to make it easier to create extensions and expand the number of use cases that could be covered without making any alterations to the core standard. Additional Resources could now support non-clinical data such as claims data and benefit processing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Standard for Trial Use 3 (STU 3)\n",
    "In 2017, the third standard for FHIR led to improvements in a multitude of FHIR components, including core Clinical, Administrative, and Financial Resources as well as Clinical Decision Support and Clinical Quality Measure Resources. Furthermore, a new framework was introduced for task management and workflow, and new tools made it easier to create FHIR implementation guides and publish them online.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Release 4 (R4)\n",
    "In 2019, the words “Trial Use” were dropped from the fourth standard for FHIR, which was simply called “Release 4.” The Patient Resource and the Observation Resource were both released as normative, as were nine other Resources and the RESTful API and the XML and JSON formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2020, the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology released the Final Rule for the 21st Century Cures Act, which identified FHIR’s Release 4 as the standard in Health IT Certification.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Looking ahead to Release 5 (R5)\n",
    "For FHIR Release 5, there will be a rise in normative content, as evidenced by more than 30 Resources being nominated by HL7 to receive that status. Additionally, supportive specifications for FHIR will be further developed—for example, the SMART authorization framework, Clinical Decision Support Hooks (CDS Hooks), and the Bulk Data Transfer Specification—all of which will enable a more comprehensive FHIR-based data exchange among healthcare systems. FHIR is expected to continue in its position of importance in the field of health IT as the integration between health-related fields continues to improve."
